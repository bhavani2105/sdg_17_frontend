   Every person, in every country in every continent is impacted in some shape or form by climate change. Climate change is caused by human activities – primarily the burning of fossil fuels like oil, coal and gas – and threatens life on Earth as we know it. With rising greenhouse gas emissions, the impacts of climate change are intensifying and accelerating,including more frequent extreme weather events like droughts, floods and storms, and rising sea levels.

If left unchecked, climate change will undo a lot of the development progress made over the past years. It can also intensify conflicts over resources and force people to move.

Currently, our planet is already about 1.2°C warmer than it was in the late 1800s, and emissions continue to rise. To keep global warming to no more than 1.5°C  – as called for in the Paris Agreement – greenhouse gas emissions must be cut by almost half by 2030 compared to 2019.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed 2024 to be the hottest year on record, at approximately 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels. The WMO estimates an 80 per cent chance that at least one of the next five years will surpass 2024 as the hottest on record.

The solutions exist
Much is happening around the world – investments in renewable energy like wind and solar have soared. But more needs to be done. The world must transform its energy, industry, transport, food, agriculture and forestry systems to ensure that we can preserve a livable planet. Many climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. 

We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.

Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. 

Financing climate action 
Climate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.

At COP29 in November 2024, governments agreed to set a New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance of at least $300 billion per year by 2035, tripling the previously agreed target. In addition, they agreed to secure efforts of all public and private entities to scale up finance to developing countries to $1.3 trillion per year by 2035. 

While every country needs to work towards net-zero emissions, each country and community also must adapt to climate change. Adaptation is the foremost priority in countries with lower emissions and acute vulnerability to climate fallout, as is the case for many small island developing States and least developed countries. Building storm-resistant housing, planting drought-tolerant crops, installing reliable water supplies and investing in social safety nets are among many adaptation essentials.

With half the world’s population now living in the climate “danger zone,” where people are 15 times more likely to die from climate impacts, the Secretary-General has called for doubling finance for adaptation. 

Adapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere, but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.
