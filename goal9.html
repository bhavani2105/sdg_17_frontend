Goal 9 seeks to build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.Goal 9 seeks to build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.Goal 9 seeks to build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.

Building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation are key drivers of economic development. Goal 9 aims to create a strong foundation for a sustainable future.

Economic growth, social development and climate action are heavily dependent on investments in infrastructure, sustainable industrial development and technological progress. In the face of a rapidly changing global economic landscape and increasing inequalities, sustained growth must include industrialization that first of all, makes opportunities accessible to all people, and second, is supported by innovation and resilient infrastructure.

Even before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, global manufacturing – considered an engine of overall economic growth – has been steadily declining due to tariffs and trade tensions. The manufacturing decline caused by the pandemic has further caused serious impacts on the global economy.

This is primarily due to high inflation, energy price shocks, persistent disruptions in the supply of raw materials and intermediate goods, and global economic deceleration.

While LDCs in Asia have made considerable progress, African LDCs would need to change the current trajectory and accelerate progress significantly to attain the target by 2030. However, medium-high and high-technology industries demonstrated robust growth rates.

How much progress have we made?
Since 2015, the world has seen remarkable progress in infrastructure development, industrial growth, and innovation. Global manufacturing value added (MVA) per capita increased by 17.3% between 2015 and 2024. Maritime freight volumes climbed to 11.6 billion metric tons in 2023, fueled by the growing involvement of developing countries. At the same time, 5G mobile broadband now reaches 51% of the global population.

Yet, deep regional inequalities remain. Many developing nations continue to face systemic challenges in achieving inclusive and sustainable industrialization. Even with widespread connectivity, 4% of the world’s population was still without access to mobile broadband networks in 2024.

What needs to be done?
Investments in infrastructure – transport, irrigation, energy and information and communication technology – are crucial to achieving sustainable development and empowering communities in many countries. To achieve Goal 9 by 2030, it is also essential to support LDCs, invest in advanced technologies, lower carbon emissions and increase mobile broadband access.

Why should I care?
Inclusive and sustainable industrialization, together with innovation and infrastructure, can unleash dynamic and competitive economic forces that generate employment and income. They play a key role in introducing and promoting new technologies, facilitating international trade and enabling the efficient use of resources.

The growth of new industries means improvement in the standard of living for many of us. If industries pursue sustainability, this approach will have a positive effect on the environment.

What is the price of inaction?
The price is steep. Ending poverty would be more difficult, given the industry’s role as a core driver of the global development agenda to eradicate poverty and advance sustainable development. Additionally, failing to improve infrastructure and promote technological innovation could translate into poor health care, inadequate sanitation and limited access to education.

How can we help?
Establish standards and promote regulations that ensure company projects and initiatives are sustainably managed.

Collaborate with NGOs and the public sector to help promote sustainable growth within developing countries.

Think about how industry impacts on your life and well-being and use social media to push for policymakers to prioritize the SDGs.
