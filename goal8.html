  Promoting sustained economic growth, productive employment and decent work for all is essential for a sustainable future. Goal 8 focuses on creating quality jobs, promoting entrepreneurship, and fostering economic growth that benefits everyone.

The journey towards achieving Goal 8 faces significant challenges due to the aftermath of COVID-19, trade tensions, rising debt in developing countries and geopolitical conflicts. These factors collectively threaten global economic growth. Although global real GDP per capita saw a rebound in 2021, it experienced a slowdown in 2022 and is projected to slow to just 1.5 per cent in 2025 due to heightened trade tensions and policy uncertainty.

While the unemployment rate fell to a record low of 5.0 per cent in 2024, nearly 58 per cent of workers remained informally employed, with persistently high rates in LDCs and sub-Saharan Africa. However, significant disparities across gender and age persist.

More progress is needed to increase employment opportunities, especially for young people, reduce informal employment and labour market inequality (particularly in terms of the gender pay gap), promote safe and secure working environments, and improve access to financial services to ensure sustained and inclusive economic growth.

Accelerating progress demands sustainable economic policies, support for entrepreneurship and innovation, formalization of the informal economy, safeguards of workers’ rights, social justice, and inclusive employment opportunities, especially for women and youth.

What does “decent work” mean?
Decent work means opportunities for everyone to get work that is productive and delivers a fair income, security in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration.

What are the challenges?
A persistent lack of decent work opportunities, insufficient investments and under-consumption contribute to the erosion of the basic social contract: that all must share in progress. The creation of quality jobs remains a major challenge for almost all economies.

Achieving Goal 8 will require a wholesale reform of the financial system to tackle rising debts, economic uncertainty and trade tensions, while promoting equitable pay and decent work for young people.

Sustained and inclusive economic growth can drive progress, create decent jobs for all and improve living standards.

How many people are unemployed?
The global unemployment rate fell to a record low of 5.0 per cent in 2024, down from 6.0 per cent in 2015. But disparities and vulnerabilities remain in the labour market, particularly for youth and women. Young people aged 15–24 continue to face severe difficulties in securing decent employment: in 2024, 259 million youth — one in five globally — were not in education, employment or training (NEET). Young women face the greatest barriers and are twice as likely to be NEET as young men.

What can we do to fix these issues?
Providing youth the best opportunity to transition to a decent job calls for investing in education and training of the highest possible quality, providing youth with skills that match labour market demands, giving them access to social protection and basic services regardless of their contract type, as well as leveling the playing field so that all aspiring youth can attain productive employment regardless of their gender, income level or socio-economic background.

Governments can work to build dynamic, sustainable, innovative and people-centred economies, promoting youth employment and women’s economic empowerment, in particular, and decent work for all.

Implementing adequate health and safety measures and promoting supportive working environments are fundamental to protecting the safety of workers, especially relevant for health workers and those providing essential services.
