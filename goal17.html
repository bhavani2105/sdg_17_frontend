      Goal 17 is about revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda is universal and calls for action by all countries – developed and developing – to ensure no one is left behind. It requires partnerships between governments, the private sector, and civil society.

The Sustainable Development Goals can only be realized with a strong commitment to global partnership and cooperation to ensure no one is left behind in our journey to development.

However, not all countries are setting off from the same start line, and low and middle income countries are facing a tidal wave of debt which they are treading water.

Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) faced record-high $1.4 trillion debt-servicing costs in 2023, compounded by a $4 trillion annual investment gap to achieve the SDGs. Foreign direct investment flows to developing countries have decreased. The Secretary-General has urged countries to support an SDG Stimulus of at least $500 billion annually. The current investment gap is 60 per cent higher than the $2.5 trillion estimated in 2019. The increase results from shortfalls since 2015, compounded by multiple global challenges, including the pandemic and the food, fuel and financing crises. Despite increased financial flows from official and private sources, the Official Development Assistance (ODA) declined by 7.1 per cent after five years of growth, with further cuts expected through 2025

In 2024, (ODA) from Development Assistance Committee members reached a total of $212.2 billion, accounting for 0.33% of their combined gross national income. This marked a 7.1 per cent decline in real terms from 2023, marking the first drop after five years of consecutive growth, largely driven by reduced contributions to international organizations, lower aid for Ukraine, decreased humanitarian aid and reduced spending on hosting refugees in donor countries.

To be successful, everyone will need to mobilize both existing and additional resources, and developed countries will need to fulfill their official development assistance commitments.

Why?
In light of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen that strengthening multilateralism and global partnerships are more important than ever if we are to solve the world’s problems.

Why does this matter to me?
We are all in this together. The Agenda, with its 17 goals, is universal and calls for action by all countries, both developed countries and developing countries, to ensure no one is left behind.

How much progress have we made?
Support for implementing the SDGs has been steady but fragile, with major and persistent challenges.

Financial resources remain scarce, trade tensions have been increasing, and crucial data are still lacking.

A growing share of the global population has access to the Internet, and a Technology Bank for Least Developed Countries has been established, yet the digital divide persists.

As partners, what would we need to do to reach this?
We will need to mobilize both existing and additional resources— technology development, financial resources, capacity building— and developed countries will need to fulfill their official development assistance commitments.

Multistakeholder partnerships will be crucial to leverage the inter-linkages between the Sustainable Development Goals to enhance their effectiveness and impact and accelerate progress in achieving the Goals.

How can we ensure the resources needed are effectively mobilized?
This will be primarily the responsibility of countries. Reviews of progress will need to be undertaken regularly in each country, involving civil society, business and representatives of various interest groups. At the regional level, countries will share experiences and tackle common issues, while on an annual basis, at the United Nations, the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), they will take stock of progress at the global level, identifying gaps and emerging issues, and recommending corrective action.
